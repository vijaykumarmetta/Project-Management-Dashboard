# Project-Management-Dashboard
A clean, modern analytics dashboard to track end-to-end project performance across departments.
📌 Project Management Dashboard

A visually rich, KPI-driven Project Management Dashboard designed for tracking project portfolio performance across multiple departments (Admin & BI, eCommerce, Sales & Marketing, Supply Chain, Warehouse).

This repository contains the dashboard file and supporting data/model that showcase how to monitor cost, benefits, status, and progress of projects in a single view.

🎯 Objective

The goal of this dashboard is to give project managers, PMOs, and leadership a quick, intuitive view of project health, answering questions like:

Are our projects delivering net benefits?

How are costs vs benefits trending over time?

Which phases and departments are performing well or lagging behind?

What is the overall completion percentage of the portfolio?

How many projects are in progress, completed, on hold, or cancelled?

📊 Key Highlights
1. KPI Summary Cards (Top Section)

Total Project Cost (107M)

Total Project Benefit (212M)

Net Benefit (106M)

Average Completion (88%)

These KPIs give a quick snapshot of financial performance and overall delivery health.

2. Department Navigation (Left Panel)

A vertical button menu for departments:

Admin & BI

eCommerce

Sales & Marketing

Supply Chain

Warehouse

Selecting a department filters the entire dashboard, helping users focus on a specific area while maintaining the same visual structure.

3. Project Cost vs Project Benefit by Year (Center Line Chart)

A time-series visual that compares:

Project Cost (e.g., purple line)

Project Benefit (e.g., yellow line)

For years such as 2021–2025, allowing users to see:

When benefits started overtaking costs

How investment and returns are evolving over time

Whether the portfolio is moving in the right direction

4. Project Manager Panel (Right Side)

A dedicated card listing Project Managers, for example:

Aleena Khan

Brenda Chandler

This gives quick context around ownership and accountability for the currently selected department or filters.

5. Complexity of Projects (Bottom Left – Bar Chart)

6. Count of Projects by Status (Bottom Middle – Donut Chart)

Donut/pie visual showing project counts and percentages for each status:

This offers a clear view of overall delivery pipeline health and bottlenecks.

Phase-wise average completion percentage, such as:

Explore – 92.00%

Implement – 90.33%

Measure – 88.33%

Plan – 87.60%

This makes it easy to see which phase is lagging and where process improvements may be needed.
